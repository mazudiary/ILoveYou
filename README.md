## 💗 just you and me  
> “i don’t need the whole world… just your hand in mine.”  

this isn’t just a project.  
this is a piece of my heart.  
i made this for you, my butterfly —  
the one who makes the sky look softer,  
the days feel warmer,  
and life a little more magical.

it’s 145 little ways of saying what i feel every second of every day:  
**i love you.**

## 🌼 once upon a ‘us’  
a boy met a girl with stars in her eyes and butterflies in her laugh.  
he didn’t know it then,  
but he had just met home.

this little corner of the internet is for you.  
where love speaks in every language,  
and every whisper says:  
“i choose you. again and again.”
